**Problem**
I have hidden a flag in my catbox link. But what could be the link? (use all lowercase)
Image: [e01838_catbox.png](./e01838_catbox.png).
Answer: `dbdth{schrodinger_cat_in_box}`.

Note that since discord changed its color when sent, we changed the flag to: `dbdth{b3133a}`

**Solution:**
The hex id of the color is #E01848. So the catbox link(may have expired) turned out to be: https://files.catbox.moe/e01848

- Goto `dir/.dir/.oops_spotted`: `dbdth{oops_you_found_me_hiding}`
- Goto `dir/.dir/.another_dir/.yet_another_dir/found_me`: `dbdth{dot_directories_are_hidden}`

After XORbitron's evil schemes faltered, his smaller and eviler cousin RGBitron rose from the shadows. Fortunately, I uncovered a three-part secret plan hidden by him across the world. Unfortunately, I cannot make any sense of it. Can you help me here?

Yet another message from RGBitron has been uncovered: "The sum might be greater than the parts, but each part tells its own story."
Hmm... I wonder if that is related?
(this is a hint, not a flag)

RGBitron hates his elder cousin. He doesn't have much in common with him except the name (and maybe the propensity for hiding secrets in multiple images)
(this is a hint, not a flag)

I just whipped up this one today. https://anirudhg07.github.io/maze/. It takes a lot more time to make a problem than solving it uk...

**Solution:**

- Go outside the maze and go to the red box directly: `dbdth{sometimes_think_outside_the_box}`
- Go to the top right single tiled wall. That's a fake wall and then from there you can go to the yellow box: `dbdth{fake_wall_from_outside_the_box}`

This monke brain is a far more sophisticated tool than whatever you get on Opening a Stegosaurus' skull. Look behind for any monkeys spying in for I'm bout to leave one of their secret messages meant very specifically for you. Thought not very long it seeks to bring to you something profound to your very existence.
