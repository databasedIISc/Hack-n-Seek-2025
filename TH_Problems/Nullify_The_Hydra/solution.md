Two ways to do this

1. Go to the source code, notice the usage of Cookies in the code. So you just go to cookies, set the `hydraCount` = 0 and Refresh. Answer: `dbdth{no_cookies_no_hydra}`

2. Go the source code, I didnt want put the flag directly there, so just broke it and did base64 on each part. But i should have a read a file, so you HAD to go to the COOKIES. SO basically you collect the parts and base64 decode it.
