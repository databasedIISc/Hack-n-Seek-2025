Well go to Pypi website. Download the source code by uncompressing it.

Then go to the `pyproject.toml` and you have your MAIN answer as `dbdth{looking_at_the_source_code}`

For the frenzies:

1. If you run `main.py`, that's a long wait because there is a lot of EXTRA waste time I put there. SO just remove it and run the code. You get: `dbdth{wow_that_was_a_long_wait}`.

2. If you go to the other file, you will see another flag encoded there. But if you run the code to run the `decode` function, it will throw error since the input passed is WRONG. Change the variable name(simply change it to uppercase) and run the code. You will get: `dbdth{good_you_know_how_to_debug}`
