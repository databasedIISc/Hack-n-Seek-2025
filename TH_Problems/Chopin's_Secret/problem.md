# Chopin's Secret

Frédéric Chopin, regarded as the poet of the piano, composed entire worlds with nothing but 88 keys and an aching heart.

But few know of his final, considered to be unfinished, piece. It is a short, repetitive composition found scrawled in a notebook hidden beneath the floorboards of his Paris apartment. Just nine notes, repeated over and over. This was one of the two 'valueables' he had, the other being a signed copy of the play 'Julius Caesar' by Shakespeare.

Musicologists dismissed it as a forgotten sketch. However recent digital analysis reveals a code hidden in the message.

Could it be that Chopin, a century ahead of his time, encoded a message for the future?

Listen carefully.
