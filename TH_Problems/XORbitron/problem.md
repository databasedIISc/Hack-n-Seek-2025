# Mission Briefing: Operation XORbitron

**Good morning, Agent.**

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves tracking down a rogue artificial intelligence known as **XORbitron**, which has encrypted the coordinates to its hidden data vault using a classified **visual cipher**.

XORbitron has fragmented the key into **four separate image files**, now dispersed across the **cyber-web**. The vault remains sealed.  
- **Its contents:** Unknown  
- **Its risk:** Classified  

As always, should you or any member of your IMF team be **caught or killed**, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.
