Two ways to do this:

1. One flag will come flying around 700 score. One part will come flying 1400 and you are done. Answer: `dbdth{dino_game_t_rex}`. The elite score is 1337 btw.
2. Check the source code. Search for `dbdth` and you will get `dbdth{dino_game` and look around and you will get `t_rex}` too
