This is very straightforward manual solving problem.

Your initial step is to reverse the `brain` function on `hwoqlhzanafhdwj`, which is explained in the problem statement. You will finally get `serfutramoenvam`, this you can reverse the `rot13` function on it to get `frehsgenzbrainz`.

I have attached the code which creates the brainrot13 for me: [brainrot.py](./brainrot.py)
