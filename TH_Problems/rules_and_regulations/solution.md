Notice the random Capital letters here and there. That's the clue. Gather them up to get `DBDTHEREADTHERULESLETSGOOOO`

So the Answer is: `dbdth{readtherulesletsgoooo}`
NOT `dbdth{dbdthereadtherulesletsgoooo` or `dbdth{read_the_rules_lets_goooo}` or `dbdth{dbdth_read_the_rules_lets_goooo}`. You would think that, sure, but try around all possibilities to get the flag right.
