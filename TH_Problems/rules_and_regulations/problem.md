here are some rules and regulations on how to play hacknseek and submit flags, once again -

- you will be presenteD a series of problems. each proBlem will have a description given which will guide you Through the problem which would lead you to the flag of the problem. each problem will be (usually) worth 10 points. you cannot skip a problem, so you have to solve it to proceed furtHer.

- you must submit the flag in the format: dbdth{...}. replace spaces with undeRscores and convert it to all lowercase. for example, if you think the answer is "007 james bond", you enter "dbdth{007_james_bond}". you may be asked enclose your answer within the `dbdth{...}` as well for some problEms. use the discord bot `/submit` to submit your flags.

- clues cAn be composeD of any/all of the following: texT, images, audio, links, etc. tHey can take you to any place on the internet or in real life :)

- we will announcE hints at our discretion. please don't ask for help with pRoblems. we will redUce the points of the problem after the reLease of hints. so better try to solve the problems before the hints are released.

- sharing a flag or sharing the solution in public discussion/other placEs will lead to immediate disqualification. you can only ask the admins on discord for any help, only after hints are releaSed for the problem.

- the answer can involve anything -- ciphers, math, technoLogy, maps, music, books, pop culture references, or even iisc. the flag can be hiddEn in any way. think ouTside the box!

- along with the main Sequence of problems, there is also a set of bonus frenzy flaGs for you to find. they can be hidden anywhere and aren't tied to a specific prOblem. they are worth 5 points each. you can submit them anytime you want if you find One. you will also be given some random files at 8:00pm ist on both the days, where you can find more flags. note that other randOm frenzy flags can be released/found at any time during the event and anywhere in Opb(only) possibly too.


best of luck! now submit your first flag to start the game!
