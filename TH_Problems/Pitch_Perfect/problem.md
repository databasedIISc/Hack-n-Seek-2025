Neil sprints through the dark corridors of Osborne Industries, breathless and bleeding, the weight of a world-altering discovery pulsing in his mind. He's uncovered a secret a chilling revelation about the government's growing surveillance machinery, discovering the orwellian society we live in.

He doesn't waste pixels.

Somewhere in that stream of shades is the **flag** and the truth.

> Decipher the image. Uncover the message.
