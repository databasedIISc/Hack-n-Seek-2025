Go to the OPB courtyard where the grass is there. You will see a note with a rock on it(so that it doesn't fly away)

YOU FINALLY TOUCHED GRASS!!!!

Funny thing. Initially we set the flag as `dbdth{you_finally_touched_grass}` but when going to put it there, the person forgot about it and finally put `dbdth{ultimate_mission}` hehe.
