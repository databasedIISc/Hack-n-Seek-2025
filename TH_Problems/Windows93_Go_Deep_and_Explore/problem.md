Back in the olden days, when our generation were still non-existant, in womb or practically unconscious, windows was one of the most used OS's. But sadly, that version of Windows doesn't exist or atleast unsupported in machines today.

OR DOES IT????

[Windows93](https://windows93.net) is a sick-ass website still available online! And many people have made websites simulating lightweight OS's!

Windows93 uploaded his private content inside `/c/files/documents`. Go inside as deep as possible to find his private file. Your flag is `dbdth{i_just_saw_???}` where replace `???` with the name of the file(without the extension in lowercase). For example, if file is `HIS_5318008.txt`, your flag is `dbdth{i_just_saw_his_5318008}`.

**ðŸš¨ FRENZY FLAG ALERT! ðŸš¨** Be on the lookout for this special competition flag!

1. Do you know about the `ILOVEYOU` Virus????
   Your task is to search the filesystem, and find the file `ILOVEYOU.txt`. Enclose the integer value of key "time" in the file within `dbdth{...}`!

2. Check out `Potato.yt` on the desktop! Watch it! Where do I download the whole album??? Enclose the website (all lowercase) within `dbdth{...}`!

3. Go to `Trash` on Desktop. What is the product of Image Height and Image Width of `poneyyyyy.jpg` image? Enclose the output (format as mentioned in Hack&Seek Rules) in `dbdth{...}`!

4. In `Storage(A:)`, read the README.txt. What is the philosophy they follow? Again, enclose the output within quotations(excluding them) in `dbdth{...}`!

5. Go to ASCII Gallery on Desktop, See `Microsft` Ascii. Why they call the company MICROSOFT??? Again, enclose the output (format as mentioned in Hack&Seek Rules) in `dbdth{...}`!
