Aditey Nandan is an internet fanatic. While randomly searching the internet, she came up on The Longest website, called Infinite Homepage. Having already failed at karma farming herself on Urban Dictionary, she decided to post up her farm on this Infinite Homepage. However, her wannabe character came in the way and she "encrypted" the data, only to get messed up due to, ahem, uncertain reasons and unaliving herself. (Whatever you decode, you have to decode the output within dbdth{...} to submit, for example, you decode the data as "dance_sing", you need to submit the flag as dbdth{dance_sing}.)
